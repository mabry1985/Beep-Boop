# _Beep Boop!_

#### _Input a number and watch the bot count up to it, 6/20/2019_

#### By _**Josh Mabry**_

## Description

_This application takes a number from a user and counts up to it one at a time. Anytime the number contains a 1 it returns 'BEEP!', if it contains a 2 it returns 'BOOP!', if it contains a 3 it returns 'I'm sorry, Dave....'. If there are more than one of these numbers then the highest of the 3 overrides the others. Example: 12 would return BOOP! and not BEEP!_

## Setup/Installation Requirements
